```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
PICAOS_SECRET_KEY=your_picaos_api_key
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
# Apply all migrations in order
supabase db push
```

5. Deploy Edge Functions:

## üì± Usage

### Setting Up the Database

1. **Create Tables**: Run the migration files in order:
   - `create_reports_table.sql`
   - `create_donations_table.sql`
   - `create_missions_table.sql`
   - `update_profiles_table.sql`

2. **Set Up Storage**: Run `create_storage_policies.sql` to configure secure video storage

3. **Add Database Functions**: Execute `shared/database-functions.sql` for geospatial utilities

### Authentication Flow

1. Users sign up with email/password and select their role (citizen or facilitator)
2. Profile is automatically created with role-based permissions
3. Role validation ensures users can only access appropriate features

### Citizen Workflow

1. **Report a Need**:
   - Select location on map
   - Add description and people count
   - Optionally record video context
   - Submit report for matching

2. **Log a Donation**:
   - Specify resource type and quantity
   - Set pickup location and contact details
   - Add pickup time preferences
   - Submit for automatic matching

3. **Track Impact**:
   - View activity history
   - Receive notifications when missions are completed
   - Read personalized thank you letters

### Facilitator Workflow

1. **View Available Missions**:
   - Browse missions sorted by proximity
   - See pickup and delivery details
   - View video context if available

2. **Accept and Execute Mission**:
   - Accept mission assignment
   - Update status through lifecycle:
     - `assigned` ‚Üí `en_route_pickup` ‚Üí `pickup_completed` ‚Üí `en_route_delivery` ‚Üí `completed`

3. **Complete Mission**:
   - Automatic thank you letter generation
   - Push notifications to citizens
   - Mission marked as completed
